# Ignore folders and files that should not be in Git:
# 
# __pycache__   -> Python automatically generates these
#                   compiled files (.pyc) when scripts run.
#                   They are not needed in the repo and
#                   can cause unnecessary changes in commits.
#
# venv           -> Ignore this virtual environment folder too if Git didn't do it automatically.
#                   It contains installed packages for your
#                   local setup and should not be tracked.
#                   Other developers can install packages
#                   using requirements.txt instead.
