# FastAPI Learning Project

This repository contains my practice project while learning **FastAPI**, Python, and building APIs.  
The goal is to document my progress, experiment with endpoints, and apply concepts I learn in real-time.

---

## Project Overview

- **Framework:** FastAPI  
- **Python Version:** 3.x  
- **Purpose:** Learning how to build RESTful APIs, use Pydantic models, handle requests, and structure code.  
- **Main file:** `main.py` contains the API endpoints and experiments.

## Features Implemented

- `POST /createposts` – Create a post by sending JSON data in the request body.  
- **Pydantic models** – For request validation and structured data.  
- **Body parameters** – Using `Body(...)` to read data from requests.
