# ⚠️ Warning: Don’t Rename Folders While VS Code Is Open - Sep 20 2025 : 10:35PM

Renaming folders while VS Code is open can cause:

- Broken file links (open files may “disappear”).
- Git confusion (files may appear deleted or moved).
- Extensions to stop working.

✅ **Safe way:**  
Rename folders **inside VS Code** or **close VS Code** before renaming externally.
